/**
 * The TCP timestamp option is a TCP option that allows each end of a TCP
 * connection to keep track of the round-trip time (RTT) of packets sent over
 * the connection. The RTT is the time it takes for a packet to travel from one
 * end of the connection to the other and back again.
 * <p>
 * The TCP timestamp option is a 16-byte option. The first 8 bytes of the option
 * contain the timestamp value for the sending end of the connection. The second
 * 8 bytes of the option contain the timestamp value for the receiving end of
 * the connection.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The TCP timestamp option is used by both the sender and receiver to calculate
 * the RTT of packets sent over the connection. The RTT is used by the TCP
 * congestion control algorithm to determine how quickly data can be sent over
 * the connection.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The TCP timestamp option is supported by most modern TCP implementations. It
 * is enabled by default in most operating systems and web browsers.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Here are some of the benefits of using the TCP timestamp option:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Improved congestion control: The TCP timestamp option can help the TCP
 * congestion control algorithm to more accurately determine the RTT of packets
 * sent over the connection. This can lead to improved performance and
 * reliability of TCP connections.</li>
 * <li>Improved debugging: The TCP timestamp option can be used to help debug
 * TCP connections. By looking at the RTT values, it can be determined where
 * bottlenecks are in the network.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * The TCP timestamp option is a valuable tool for improving the performance,
 * reliability, and debugging of TCP connections. It can be used to improve the
 * performance of web browsing, file transfers, and other applications that use
 * TCP.
