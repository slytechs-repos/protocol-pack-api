/**
 * The TCP MSS option is a TCP option that specifies the maximum segment size
 * (MSS) that can be sent over the connection. The MSS is the largest amount of
 * data, specified in bytes, that a computer or communications device can
 * receive in a single TCP segment. MSS does not include the TCP header or the
 * IP header.
 * <p>
 * The MSS option is used to prevent data from being fragmented, which can lead
 * to performance problems. When a TCP segment is fragmented, it is broken up
 * into smaller pieces that must be reassembled by the receiver. This can add
 * overhead and delay to the transmission of data.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The MSS option is negotiated during the TCP handshake. Both the sender and
 * receiver send their MSS values in the SYN packet. The MSS value that is used
 * for the connection is the smallest of the two values.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The default MSS value is 536 bytes. However, this value can be changed if the
 * network or the application requires a larger or smaller MSS. For example, if
 * the network has a small MTU, the MSS must be reduced to avoid fragmentation.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The MSS option is an important part of the TCP protocol. It helps to ensure
 * that data is transmitted efficiently and reliably.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Here are some additional details about the TCP MSS option:

 * <li>The TCP MSS option is a 4-byte option.</li>

	 * Gets the TCP MSS mss field value.
	 * <p>
	 * The MSS option is a 16-bit option. The first 8 bits of the option contain the
	 * MSS value for the sending host. The second 8 bits of the option contain the
	 * MSS value for the receiving host.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * If the MSS options are not negotiated, the default MSS value is 536 bytes.
	 * However, the MSS value can be negotiated to a larger value if the network
	 * supports it.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * The MSS option is important for two reasons. First, it helps to prevent
	 * fragmentation. Fragmentation occurs when a TCP segment is too large to be
	 * sent in a single IP packet. When fragmentation occurs, the IP layer breaks
	 * the TCP segment into multiple IP packets. This can cause problems, such as
	 * lost data and increased latency.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * Second, the MSS option helps to improve performance. By limiting the size of
	 * TCP segments, the MSS option helps to reduce the number of IP packets that
	 * need to be sent. This can improve performance by reducing the amount of time
	 * it takes to send data over the network.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * The MSS option is supported by most TCP implementations. It is enabled by
	 * default in most operating systems and web browsers.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * Here are some of the benefits of using the TCP MSS option:
	 * </p>
	 * <ul>
	 * <li>Reduced fragmentation: The TCP MSS option can help to reduce
	 * fragmentation by limiting the size of TCP segments.</li>
	 * <li>Improved performance: The TCP MSS option can improve performance by
	 * reducing the number of IP packets that need to be sent.</li>
	 * <li>Improved reliability: The TCP MSS option can improve reliability by
	 * reducing the chance of data loss.</li>
	 * </ul>
	 * <p>
	 * The TCP MSS option is a valuable tool for improving the performance,
	 * reliability, and security of TCP connections. It can be used to improve the
	 * performance of web browsing, file transfers, and other applications that use
	 * TCP.
	 * </p>
