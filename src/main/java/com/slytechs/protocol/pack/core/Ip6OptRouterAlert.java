	 * <p>
	 * The IPv4 router alert option field is a 2-byte field that is used to indicate
	 * that the packet should be handled specially by routers. The value of the
	 * field is an opaque identifier that is used by the router to determine how to
	 * handle the packet.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * The router alert option field was originally defined in RFC 2113 and is used
	 * by protocols such as RSVP (Resource Reservation Protocol) to indicate that
	 * the packet contains a reservation request. Routers that support RSVP will
	 * inspect the packet and, if necessary, reserve resources along the path of the
	 * packet.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * The router alert option field can also be used by other protocols to indicate
	 * that the packet contains special handling instructions. For example, the
	 * IPsec protocol uses the router alert option field to indicate that the packet
	 * is encrypted.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * The router alert option field is a valuable tool for improving the
	 * performance and security of IP networks. By allowing protocols to indicate
	 * special handling instructions, the router alert option field allows routers
	 * to take the necessary steps to ensure that packets are delivered reliably and
	 * securely.
