/**
 * The TCP window scale option is a TCP option that allows the sender and
 * receiver to increase the size of the receive window beyond the default value
 * of 65,535 bytes. The receive window is the amount of data that the receiver
 * can buffer before it needs to send an acknowledgment to the sender.
 * <p>
 * The TCP window scale option is a 3-byte option. The first byte of the option
 * contains the window scale factor. The window scale factor is a number between
 * 0 and 14. The window scale factor is multiplied by the default receive window
 * size of 65,535 bytes to calculate the actual receive window size.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For example, if the window scale factor is 2, then the actual receive window
 * size is 2 * 65,535 = 131,072 bytes.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The TCP window scale option is supported by most modern TCP implementations.
 * It is enabled by default in most operating systems and web browsers.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Here are some of the benefits of using the TCP window scale option:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Increased throughput: The TCP window scale option can increase the
 * throughput of TCP connections by allowing the sender to send more data before
 * it needs to wait for an acknowledgment.</li>
 * <li>Improved reliability: The TCP window scale option can improve the
 * reliability of TCP connections by reducing the number of retransmissions
 * needed.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * The TCP window scale option is a valuable tool for improving the performance
 * and reliability of TCP connections. It can be used to improve the performance
 * of web browsing, file transfers, and other applications that use TCP.
 * </p>
