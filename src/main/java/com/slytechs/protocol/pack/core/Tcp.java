/**
 * Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) header.
 * <p>
 * The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is a connection-oriented protocol
 * that provides a reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of a stream of
 * octets (bytes) between applications running on hosts communicating via an IP
 * network. Major internet applications such as the World Wide Web, email,
 * remote administration, and file transfer rely on TCP, which is part of the
 * Transport Layer of the TCP/IP suite. SSL/TLS often runs on top of TCP.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * TCP is a connection-oriented protocol, which means that a connection is
 * established between the two hosts before any data is sent. This connection is
 * used to keep track of the data that is being sent and received, and to ensure
 * that the data is delivered in the correct order.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * TCP provides a number of features that make it a reliable protocol:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li><b>Connection establishment:</b> TCP uses a three-way handshake to
 * establish a connection between two hosts. This ensures that both hosts are
 * ready to receive data before any data is sent.</li>
 * <li><b>Flow control:</b> TCP uses flow control to ensure that the sender does
 * not send data too quickly for the receiver to handle. This is done by using a
 * window size, which is the maximum amount of data that the sender can send
 * without waiting for an acknowledgment from the receiver.</li>
 * <li><b>Error detection:</b> TCP uses a checksum to detect errors in the data
 * that is being sent. If an error is detected, the sender will resend the
 * data.</li>
 * <li><b>Retransmission:</b> If data is lost or corrupted, TCP will retransmit
 * the data. This ensures that all of the data is eventually delivered to the
 * receiver.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * TCP is a complex protocol, but it is essential for reliable communication
 * over the internet.
 * </p>

	 * TCP window scaling is a technique used to increase the window size of a TCP
	 * connection beyond the default 65,535 bytes. This is done by using a window
	 * scale factor, which is a 3-bit field in the TCP header. The window scale
	 * factor can be set from 0 to 14, which allows for a maximum window size of
	 * 1,073,741,824 bytes.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * To calculate the actual window size, the window scale factor is multiplied by
	 * 2^14, or 16,384. For example, if the window scale factor is 3, the actual
	 * window size will be 1,073,741,824 bytes.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * TCP window scaling is used to improve the performance of TCP connections by
	 * allowing the sender to send more data before it must wait for an
	 * acknowledgment from the receiver. This can be especially beneficial for
	 * connections with high bandwidth and low latency.
