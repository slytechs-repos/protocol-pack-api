/**
 * IPv4 quick start option header.
 * <p>
 * The Quick Start option is used to improve the performance of TCP connections
 * by allowing the sender to send data at a higher rate without having to wait
 * for an ACK from the receiver. The Quick Start option works by providing the
 * receiver with information about the sender's congestion control algorithm.
 * This information allows the receiver to send ACKs more frequently, which
 * allows the sender to send data at a higher rate.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The Quick Start option is supported by most modern operating systems.
 * However, it is important to note that not all routers support the Quick Start
 * option. As a result, it is important to check the documentation for the
 * routers that will be used to ensure that the Quick Start option is supported.
