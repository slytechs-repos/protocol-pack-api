/**
 * The TCP Selective Acknowledgment (SACK) option is a TCP option that allows
 * the receiver to acknowledge non-consecutive data, so that the sender can
 * retransmit only what is missing at the receiver's end.
 * <p>
 * SACK works by the receiver including a list of ranges of data that it has
 * received in its acknowledgment packets. The sender then uses this list to
 * determine which segments it needs to retransmit.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * SACK is a more efficient way to handle lost data than the traditional
 * cumulative acknowledgment scheme used by TCP. With cumulative
 * acknowledgments, the sender only knows which segments have been received if
 * they are at the beginning of the receive window. With SACK, the sender can
 * know which segments have been received even if they are not at the beginning
 * of the receive window.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * SACK is supported by most modern TCP implementations. It is enabled by
 * default in most operating systems and web browsers.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Here are some of the benefits of using SACK:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Reduced retransmissions: SACK can reduce the number of retransmissions
 * needed by the sender. This is because the sender only needs to retransmit the
 * segments that have not been received, rather than the entire window.</li>
 * <li>Increased throughput: SACK can increase the throughput of TCP connections
 * by allowing the sender to send more data before it needs to wait for an
 * acknowledgment.</li>
 * <li>Improved reliability: SACK can improve the reliability of TCP connections
 * by reducing the number of lost packets.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * SACK is a valuable tool for improving the performance and reliability of TCP
 * connections. It can be used to improve the performance of web browsing, file
 * transfers, and other applications that use TCP.

	 * Gets the TCP SACK block field value.
	 * <p>
	 * The TCP SACK block field is a field in the TCP Selective Acknowledgment
	 * (SACK) option that is used to identify a range of data that has been received
	 * by the receiver. The SACK block field is 8 bytes long and consists of two
	 * 32-bit unsigned integers:
	 * </p>
	 * <ul>
	 * <li><b>Left edge of block:</b> This is the first sequence number of the range
	 * of data that has been received.</li>
	 * <li><b>Right edge of block:</b> This is the sequence number immediately
	 * following the last sequence number of the range of data that has been
	 * received.</li>
	 * </ul>
	 * <p>
	 * The SACK block field is used by the sender to determine which segments it
	 * needs to retransmit. If the sender receives a SACK option from the receiver
	 * that includes a SACK block, then the sender knows that the receiver has
	 * received all of the data in the range of sequence numbers specified by the
	 * SACK block. The sender can then discard any segments that are in the range of
	 * sequence numbers specified by the SACK block. The SACK block field is
	 * supported by most modern TCP implementations. It is enabled by default in
	 * most operating systems and web browsers.
	 * </p>

	 * Here are some of the benefits of using the SACK block field:
	 * </p>
	 * <ul>
	 * <li>Reduced retransmissions: The SACK block field can reduce the number of
	 * retransmissions needed by the sender. This is because the sender only needs
