/**
 * The ICMP version 4 echo message header.
 * <p>
 * The ICMP echo message is a type of ICMP message that is used to test the
 * reachability of a network device. The ICMP echo message is also known as a
 * ping request.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The ICMP echo message has the following format:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Type: The type field is 8 bits long and specifies the type of ICMP
 * message. The type for an ICMP echo message is 8.</li>
 * <li>Code: The code field is 8 bits long and provides additional information
 * about the ICMP message. The code for an ICMP echo message is always 0.</li>
 * <li>Checksum: The checksum field is 16 bits long and is used to verify the
 * integrity of the ICMP message. The checksum is calculated by adding the
 * 16-bit values of all the fields in the ICMP header and the data field, and
 * then taking the one's complement of the result.</li>
 * <li>Identifier: The identifier field is 16 bits long and is used to identify
 * the ICMP echo message. The identifier is typically a random number that is
 * generated by the sender.</li>
 * <li>Sequence Number: The sequence number field is 16 bits long and is used to
 * sequence the ICMP echo messages. The sequence number is incremented for each
 * ICMP echo message that is sent.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * The ICMP echo message is sent by the sender to the destination device. The
 * destination device responds with an ICMP echo reply message. The ICMP echo
 * reply message has the same format as the ICMP echo message, except that the
 * type field is 0.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The time it takes for the ICMP echo reply message to arrive is called the
 * round-trip time. The round-trip time can be used to measure the performance
 * of the network between the sender and the destination device.
 * </p>
