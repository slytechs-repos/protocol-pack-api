 * IPv6 shim6 (IPv6-in-IPv4) extension header.
 * <p>
 * The IPv6 shim header (also known as the Shim6 header) is an extension header
 * that is used to tunnel IPv6 packets over IPv4 networks. The shim6 header is
 * used to encapsulate an IPv6 packet in an IPv4 packet. This allows IPv6
 * packets to be routed over IPv4 networks, which are still the most common type
 * of network in the world.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The Shim6 extension header is a valuable tool for providing multihoming
 * support for IPv6 hosts. It allows hosts to have multiple IP addresses and to
 * use any of those addresses to send or receive datagrams. This can improve the
 * reliability and performance of IPv6 networks.
