 * IPv4 timestamp option header.

 * The timestamp option is used to record the time that a packet has spent in
 * transit. The timestamps are recorded by each router that the packet passes
 * through. The timestamps can be used to measure the performance of the network
 * and to troubleshoot routing problems.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The timestamp option is supported by most modern operating systems and
 * routers. However, it is important to note that not all routers support the
 * timestamp option. As a result, it is important to check the documentation for
 * the routers that will be used to ensure that the timestamp option is
 * supported.
