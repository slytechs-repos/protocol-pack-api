/**
 * IPv4 traceroute option header.
 * <p>
 * The traceroute option is used to trace the path that a packet takes to reach
 * its destination. The traceroute option works by sending a packet with a TTL
 * of 1. When the packet reaches a router, the router decrements the TTL of the
 * packet by 1. If the TTL of the packet is 0, the router sends an ICMP Time
 * Exceeded message back to the source of the packet. The source of the packet
 * then knows that the router is the first hop in the path to the destination.
 * The source of the packet then sends a packet with a TTL of 2. The process
 * repeats until the source of the packet reaches the destination.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The traceroute option is supported by most modern operating systems and
 * routers. However, it is important to note that not all routers support the
 * traceroute option. As a result, it is important to check the documentation
 * for the routers that will be used to ensure that the traceroute option is
 * supported.
 * </p>
