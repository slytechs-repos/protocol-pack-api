/**
 * IPv4 MTU reply option header.
 * <p>
 * The IPv4 MTU reply option is used to reply to an MTU probe option. The MTU
 * reply option is a 3-byte option with a type of 42. The first byte of the
 * option is the MTU reply ID, which is the same ID as the MTU probe option that
 * it is replying to. The second byte of the option is the MTU reply length,
 * which specifies the length of the option in bytes. The third byte of the
 * option is the MTU reply value, which is the MTU of the path between the
 * sender and the receiver.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * When a router receives a packet with an MTU probe option, it will reply with
 * an MTU reply option if it cannot forward the packet without fragmenting it.
 * The MTU reply option will contain the MTU of the router that cannot forward
 * the packet. The sender can then use this information to determine the MTU of
 * the path between the sender and the receiver.
 * </p>
